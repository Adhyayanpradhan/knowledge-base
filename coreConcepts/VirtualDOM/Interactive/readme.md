# Interactive Virtual DOM Visualization

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of a virtual DOM to efficiently update the real DOM. It includes interactive controls to add, update, and remove elements. Additionally, it visualizes the DOM as a graph using Cytoscape.js.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that includes the structure of the page and the necessary scripts and styles.
- **virtualdom.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for managing the virtual DOM, updating the real DOM, and generating the DOM graph visualization.

## Flow and Functionality

1. **Initialization**

   - The `App` class is instantiated when the page loads.
   - The `init` method initializes the real DOM and sets up event listeners.

2. **Element Controls**

   - Users can add, update, and remove elements using the controls provided.
   - The `addElement`, `updateElement`, and `removeElement` methods handle these actions.

3. **Virtual DOM Management**

   - The `VirtualDOM` class manages the virtual DOM structure.
   - Methods like `createElement`, `createTextElement`, and `updateElement` handle the creation and updating of virtual DOM nodes.

4. **Real DOM Updates**

   - The `createRealDOMNode` method creates real DOM nodes from virtual DOM nodes.
   - The `updateElement` method finds differences between the new and old virtual DOM and updates the real DOM accordingly.

5. **DOM Graph Visualization**

   - The `generateGraph` method uses Cytoscape.js to visualize the DOM as a graph.
   - Nodes and edges are created based on the virtual DOM structure.

6. **Diffing & Operations Log**
   - The `logOperation` method logs operations performed on the DOM.
   - The `highlightElement` method provides visual feedback for added, updated, and removed elements.

## Visualization

- **Element Controls**: Provides controls to add, update, and remove elements in the virtual DOM.
- **Real DOM**: Displays the real DOM structure.
- **Virtual DOM Representation**: Displays the virtual DOM structure in a readable format.
- **DOM Graph Visualization**: Visualizes the DOM as a graph using Cytoscape.js.
- **Diffing & Operations Log**: Logs the operations performed on the DOM.
