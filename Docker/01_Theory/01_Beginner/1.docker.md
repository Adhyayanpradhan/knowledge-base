# Docker

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a platform for developers and sysadmins to **develop, deploy, and run** applications with containers.
- A container is a sandboxed environment that is isolated from the host machine. It is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings. To summarize, a container is a **standard unit of software** that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
  - It can be run on a local machine, on a server, or in the cloud.
